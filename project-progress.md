# Ancient History Timeline Project: Progress Report

## Project Overview

The "Ancients" project is an interactive web-based timeline showcasing human history from prehistoric times to the modern era, with a special focus on alternative theories about pre-cataclysm advanced civilizations. The timeline presents both conventional historical understanding and theoretical perspectives about advanced civilizations that may have existed before recorded history.
