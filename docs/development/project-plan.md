# Ancient History Timeline Project Plan

## Project Overview

The "Ancients" project is an interactive web-based timeline showcasing human history from prehistoric times to the modern era, with a special focus on alternative theories about pre-cataclysm advanced civilizations. The timeline presents both conventional historical understanding and theoretical perspectives about advanced civilizations that may have existed before recorded history.

### Current Sprint (June 16-30, 2025)
1. Integrate WebGL portal effect with timeline navigation
2. Begin interactive map implementation
3. Create custom iconography for event types
4. Enhance responsive design for mobile
5. Plan civilizations section (removed from navigation until implemented)

### Next Sprint (July 1-15, 2025)
1. Complete interactive map implementation
2. Implement theme options

- Smooth scrolling at 60fps
- < 100ms response time for interactions
- < 5MB initial payload

## Content Structure

The timeline currently includes the following historical periods:

1. **PREHISTORIC PERIOD (300,000 - 24,000 BCE)**
2. **PRE-CATACLYSM ADVANCED CIVILIZATION (30,000 - c. 10,950 BCE)** [Theoretical]
3. **THE GREAT CATACLYSM (c. 10,950 - 9,750 BCE)** [Theoretical]
4. **RECOVERY & KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION (c. 9,750 - 9,600 BCE)** [Theoretical]
5. **PRE-POTTERY NEOLITHIC (9,600 - 7,000 BCE)**
6. **POTTERY NEOLITHIC (7,000 - 5,500 BCE)**
7. **CHALCOLITHIC/COPPER AGE (5,500 - 3,000 BCE)**
8. **BRONZE AGE CIVILIZATIONS (3,000 - 1,200 BCE)**

11. **EARLY MODERN PERIOD (1500 - 1800 CE)**
12. **MODERN ERA (1800 - PRESENT)**

## Modification Process

When making changes to the project:

1. Update the relevant source files following the established code patterns
2. Document changes in CHANGELOG.md with appropriate versioning
3. Update the project-plan.md file to reflect current progress
4. Make sure implementation details are documented in the implementation-guide.md
5. Test thoroughly before committing changes

## Version Control Strategy

1. Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
2. Create feature branches for new functionality
3. Use pull requests for code review
4. Tag releases with version numbers
5. Keep CHANGELOG.md updated with all significant changes

## Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for completed features
- `feature/[feature-name]` - For new feature development
- `bugfix/[bug-description]` - For bug fixes
- `release/[version]` - Preparing for a new release

## Backup and Recovery

1. Regular repository backups
2. Documentation of environment setup
3. Dependency management with package.json
4. Regular testing of restore procedures
