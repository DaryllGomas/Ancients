## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **HTML**: Provides the semantic structure and content
2. **CSS**: Split into multiple files for specific styling concerns
3. **JavaScript**: Modular files for different functionalities
4. **Data**: Structured in timeline-data.js as a maintainable object

## Key Components

### 1. Timeline Data Structure

The timeline data is structured as a JavaScript object in `timeline-data.js` with this general format:

```javascript
const timelineData = {
    "periodId": {
        title: "Period Title",
        period: "Start - End Date",
        description: "Period description",
        events: [
            {
                year: "Date",
                shortDesc: "Short description",
                title: "Event Title",
                description: "Event description",
                details: "Extended details",
                keyFigures: ["Person 1", "Person 2"],
                culturalContext: "Cultural significance",
                locations: ["Location 1", "Location 2"],
                artifacts: ["Artifact 1", "Artifact 2"],
                imageFolder: "folder/path"
            },
            // More events...
        ]
    },
    // More periods...
};
```

This structure allows for:
- Easy addition of new time periods and events
- Consistent data format for all timeline items
- Simple lookup for searching and filtering
- Future extensibility for additional data fields

### 2. Timeline Rendering

The timeline is rendered in HTML with sections for periods and items for events. Each item follows this structure:

```html
<div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="date">
        <h3>DATE</h3>
        <p>Short description</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-dot"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>EVENT TITLE</h3>
        <p>Detailed description</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Theoretical items receive an additional `theoretical` class.

### 3. Modal System

The modal system in `modal.js` dynamically generates content based on the selected timeline item:

1. Creates a modal element on page load
2. Sets up event listeners for timeline items
3. When an item is clicked:
   - Finds the corresponding data in the timeline data structure
   - Populates the modal with comprehensive information
   - Handles navigation between events in the same period
   - Provides close functionality

### 4. Search System

The search functionality spans multiple files:

- `search-enhancements.js`: Core search and filtering logic
- `subtle-search.css`: Styling for the floating search icon
- `subtle-search.js`: Toggle and interaction behavior

Key implementation details:
- Search is performed across all timeline data fields
- Results are filtered in real-time
- Keywords are highlighted in matching results
- Search state is maintained when navigating between results

### 5. Navigation System

The navigation system provides:

- Era jump buttons for quick navigation to specific periods
- Breadcrumb showing current position
- Smooth scrolling behavior

Implementation detail: The system tracks the current viewport position and updates the breadcrumb accordingly.

### 6. "Did You Know?" Feature

This feature:
- Provides period-specific interesting facts
- Randomly selects facts from a curated collection
- Offers a refresh option for seeing different facts
- Maintains visual consistency with the overall design

## CSS Architecture

The CSS follows these organizational principles:

1. **Base Styling**: `style.css` contains core styles (colors, typography, layout)
2. **Component-Specific Styles**: Separate files for major components
3. **Class Naming**: Consistent BEM-inspired naming convention
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 768px and 480px
5. **Variable Usage**: CSS custom properties for colors and key measurements
6. **Animation Standards**: Consistent timing (0.3s) and easing functions

## JavaScript Patterns

Key implementation patterns include:

1. **Event Delegation**: Used for handling clicks on dynamically generated elements
2. **Module Pattern**: Each JS file focuses on a specific functionality
3. **DOM Content Loaded**: All scripts wait for DOMContentLoaded before execution
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with JS
5. **Debouncing**: Used for scroll and search events to improve performance

## Performance Considerations

1. **Animation Optimization**: CSS transitions used instead of JavaScript where possible
2. **Lazy Loading**: Images and complex components load on-demand
3. **Event Throttling**: Scroll events are throttled to prevent performance issues
4. **Minimal DOM Manipulation**: Changes batched where possible
5. **CSS Specificity**: Careful management to avoid specificity conflicts

## Browser Compatibility

The project targets modern browsers with good CSS Grid and Flexbox support:
- Chrome/Edge 79+
- Firefox 71+
- Safari 13.1+
- iOS Safari 13.4+
- Android Chrome 81+

For older browsers, core content remains accessible but advanced features may be limited.

## Adding New Content

To add new timeline events:

1. Add the event data to the appropriate period in `timeline-data.js`
2. Ensure all required fields are completed
3. Add any associated images to the appropriate folder

To add a new time period:

1. Create a new period object in `timeline-data.js`
2. Follow the established data structure
3. Add corresponding HTML structure in `index.html`

## Future Development Guidance

When implementing Phase 2 and 3 features:

1. **Interactive Map**: Plan to use Leaflet.js, keep map data in separate files
2. **Custom Icons**: Create an icon system that can be extended for new event types
3. **Multimedia**: Implement lazy loading pattern for all media assets
4. **Theme Options**: Use CSS variables to facilitate theme switching

## Conclusion

This project is structured to support maintainability and extensibility. The modular approach allows for easy addition of new features while maintaining performance and code quality. When adding new functionality, follow the established patterns and organization to ensure consistency.
