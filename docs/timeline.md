# Ancient History Timeline

This document outlines the correct chronological order of major historical events as displayed in our timeline feature.

## Chronological Order

Events should appear in the following order (from earliest to most recent):

1. **500 BCE**: Golden Age of Greece
   - Advances in philosophy, art, and science in Athens

2. **221 BCE**: Qin Dynasty
   - Qin Shi Huang unifies China and begins the Great Wall

3. **27 BCE**: Augustus/Roman Empire
   - Roman Republic transitions to the Roman Empire under Augustus

4. **476 CE**: Fall of Rome
   - Romulus Augustulus is deposed, marking the fall of the Western Roman Empire

5. **Post-Classical Period (476 CE - 1500 CE)**
   - This period should begin at 476 CE to align with the Fall of Rome event

## Timeline Display Guidelines

- Events must be displayed in chronological order from earliest (top) to most recent (bottom)
- BCE dates follow reverse numerical order (larger numbers are earlier)
- Use BCE for dates before year 1 and CE for dates after
- Period sections should align with the events they contain (e.g., Post-Classical Period starts at 476 CE)
- Ensure no chronological inconsistencies between events and period markers

## Additional Notes

- The transition from Classical to Post-Classical period is marked by the Fall of Rome (476 CE)
- Each timeline entry should include both the date and a brief description of the historical significance
- For visual clarity, maintain consistent formatting across all timeline entries
