# Ancient History Timeline Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about the Ancient History Timeline project, which presents a chronological view of human history from prehistoric times to the present, based on conventional historical understanding.

## Timeline Structure

The timeline is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the following key components:

1. **Timeline Container**: The main wrapper that holds all timeline sections and items
2. **Timeline Sections**: Period headers that define major historical eras
3. **Timeline Items**: Individual historical events with dates and descriptions
4. **Timeline Dots**: Visual markers on the central timeline connecting events
5. **Vertical Line**: A central axis running through the entire timeline
